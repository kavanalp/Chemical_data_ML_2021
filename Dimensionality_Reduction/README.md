# Dimensionality Reduction Experiments

### Random Projections
  This method works best when facing very large dimensional data, therefore it is not useful in case of either of our datasets!

### PCA
* Note: in practice we need to create PCA transformer only on training set and then transform all the data with it!
* PCA viability for (50, 90, 99)% of variability
  * QM9: (7, 37, 83) out of 163 components
  * TOX21: (7, 48, 119) out of 190 components
